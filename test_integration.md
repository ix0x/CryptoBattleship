# CryptoBattleship Integration Testing Guide

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive integration testing for the CryptoBattleship ecosystem, validating end-to-end workflows across all 8 contracts.

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Contract Deployment Order
```solidity
// 1. Deploy GameConfig first (contains all parameters)
GameConfig gameConfig = new GameConfig(admin);

// 2. Deploy BattleshipToken (ERC20)
BattleshipToken shipToken = new BattleshipToken(admin);

// 3. Deploy NFTManager (handles all NFT types)
NFTManager nftManager = new NFTManager(admin, address(gameConfig));

// 4. Deploy TokenomicsCore (requires SHIP token and NFTManager)
TokenomicsCore tokenomics = new TokenomicsCore(
    admin,
    address(shipToken),
    address(gameConfig),
    address(nftManager)
);

// 5. Deploy StakingPool (requires SHIP token and TokenomicsCore)
StakingPool stakingPool = new StakingPool(
    admin,
    address(shipToken),
    address(tokenomics)
);

// 6. Deploy LootboxSystem (requires all above contracts)
LootboxSystem lootboxSystem = new LootboxSystem(
    admin,
    address(shipToken),
    address(nftManager),
    address(tokenomics),
    address(gameConfig)
);

// 7. Deploy MarketplaceCore (requires NFTManager and TokenomicsCore)
MarketplaceCore marketplace = new MarketplaceCore(
    admin,
    address(nftManager),
    address(shipToken),
    address(tokenomics)
);

// 8. Deploy BattleshipGame (requires GameConfig, NFTManager, TokenomicsCore)
BattleshipGame game = new BattleshipGame(admin);
```

### 2. Cross-Contract Integration Setup
```solidity
// Set contract addresses in BattleshipGame
game.setContractAddresses(
    address(gameConfig),
    address(nftManager),
    address(tokenomics)
);

// Set minter role for TokenomicsCore in BattleshipToken
shipToken.setMinter(address(tokenomics));

// Set authorized contracts in TokenomicsCore
tokenomics.setAuthorizedContract(address(game), true);
tokenomics.setAuthorizedContract(address(lootboxSystem), true);
tokenomics.setAuthorizedContract(address(marketplace), true);

// Set minter role for LootboxSystem in NFTManager
nftManager.setMinter(address(lootboxSystem), true);

// Set TokenomicsCore address in StakingPool
stakingPool.setTokenomicsCore(address(tokenomics));

// Set revenue distribution addresses in TokenomicsCore
tokenomics.setStakingPool(address(stakingPool));
```

## End-to-End Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Complete Game Lifecycle
**Objective**: Test full game flow from NFT acquisition to game completion

#### Step 1: Player Preparation
```solidity
// Players buy lootboxes to get NFTs
address player1 = 0x...;
address player2 = 0x...;

// Player 1 opens lootbox
lootboxSystem.openLootbox{value: 0.1 ether}(player1);
// Verify: Player1 receives 1 Ship NFT, possibly Action/Captain/Crew

// Player 2 opens lootbox  
lootboxSystem.openLootbox{value: 0.1 ether}(player2);
// Verify: Player2 receives 1 Ship NFT, possibly Action/Captain/Crew

// Both players may need additional ships, so open more lootboxes
// until they have complete fleets (5 ships minimum)
```

#### Step 2: Game Creation and Joining
```solidity
// Player 1 creates game
uint256 gameId = game.createGame{value: 1 ether}(
    BattleshipGame.GameSize.FISH, // Medium size game
    1 ether // Entry fee
);

// Verify: Game created with correct parameters
GameInfo memory gameInfo = game.getGameInfo(gameId);
assert(gameInfo.player1 == player1);
assert(gameInfo.entryFee == 1 ether);
assert(gameInfo.status == GameStatus.WAITING);

// Player 2 joins game
uint256[] memory shipIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // NFT IDs owned by player2
uint256 captainId = 6; // Captain NFT (if owned)
uint256[] memory crewIds = [7, 8, 9]; // Crew NFTs (if owned)

game.joinGame{value: 1 ether}(gameId, shipIds, captainId, crewIds);

// Verify: Game has both players
gameInfo = game.getGameInfo(gameId);
assert(gameInfo.player2 == player2);
```

#### Step 3: Ship Placement
```solidity
// Player 1 places ships
uint8[] memory positions1 = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]; // Grid positions
BattleshipGame.ShipRotation[] memory rotations1 = [
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.HORIZONTAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.VERTICAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.HORIZONTAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.VERTICAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.HORIZONTAL
];

game.placeShips(gameId, positions1, rotations1);

// Player 2 places ships
uint8[] memory positions2 = [1, 11, 21, 31, 41]; // Different positions
BattleshipGame.ShipRotation[] memory rotations2 = [
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.VERTICAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.HORIZONTAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.VERTICAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.HORIZONTAL,
    BattleshipGame.ShipRotation.VERTICAL
];

game.placeShips(gameId, positions2, rotations2);

// Verify: Game started automatically
gameInfo = game.getGameInfo(gameId);
assert(gameInfo.status == GameStatus.ACTIVE);
assert(gameInfo.currentTurn == player1); // Player 1 goes first

// Verify: Crew stamina consumed
// Check that crew NFTs have reduced stamina
```

#### Step 4: Combat Phase
```solidity
// Player 1's turn - move ship and attack
game.moveShip(gameId, 0, 5); // Move first ship to position 5
game.defaultAttack(gameId, 50); // Attack position 50

// Verify: Actions consumed
(uint8 moves, uint8 attacks, uint8 defenses) = game.getActionsRemaining(gameId, player1);
assert(moves == 1); // 1 move remaining
assert(attacks == 0); // No attacks remaining
assert(defenses == 2); // No defenses used

// Player 1 ends turn
game.endTurn(gameId);

// Verify: Turn switched to player 2
assert(game.getCurrentTurn(gameId) == player2);

// Player 2's turn - use Action NFT
uint256 actionNFTId = 10; // Assuming player2 has action NFT
uint8[] memory targetCells = [0, 1]; // Multi-cell attack
game.useActionNFT(gameId, actionNFTId, targetCells);

// Verify: Action NFT consumed (use count decreased)
INFTManager.NFTMetadata memory metadata = nftManager.getNFTMetadata(actionNFTId);
// Check that usesRemaining decreased
```

#### Step 5: Game Completion
```solidity
// Simulate attacking until one player's ships are destroyed
// This would involve multiple turns of attacking specific positions

// When game ends, verify completion
gameInfo = game.getGameInfo(gameId);
assert(gameInfo.status == GameStatus.COMPLETED);

// Verify credit distribution occurred
// Check TokenomicsCore for awarded credits

// Verify prize money distribution
// Winner should receive ~95% of pot, 5% goes to protocol

// Check ship destruction (10% chance)
// If triggered, losing player should have one ship marked as destroyed
```

### Test 2: Cross-Contract Integration Validation

- Max skip turns from GameConfig âœ…
- Default attack damage âœ…
- Ship destruction chance âœ…
- Game fee percentage âœ…
