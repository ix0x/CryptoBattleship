## üìã DEVELOPMENT RULES

1. **NEVER modify completed files** without explicit user request
2. **ALWAYS update this file** when completing new contracts
3. **TRACK line counts** to show development progress
4. **MAINTAIN dependencies** - completed files depend on each other
5. **PRESERVE interfaces** - changing completed contracts breaks integration
